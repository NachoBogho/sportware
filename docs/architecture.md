# SportWare Architecture Overview

## Introduction
SportWare is a comprehensive management system designed for sports facilities, specifically focusing on football, tennis, paddle courts, and other sports. This document outlines the architectural design and components of the SportWare application, detailing the interactions between the frontend, backend, and database.

## Architecture Overview
The SportWare application follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers:

1. **Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, the frontend provides a modern user interface using TailwindCSS for styling. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

2. **Backend**: The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, serving as the API layer that handles business logic, data processing, and interactions with the database.

3. **Database**: MongoDB is used as the database solution, providing a flexible schema for storing data related to reservations, courts, schedules, billing, and user management.

4. **Desktop Application**: The application is packaged as a desktop application using Electron, allowing for a seamless installation and user experience on Windows.

## Component Breakdown

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for responsive and modern design
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit for global state management
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation between different pages
- **Components**: Reusable UI components (buttons, modals, tables) and specific components for dashboards, reservations, billing, etc.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **API Structure**: RESTful API endpoints for managing reservations, courts, schedules, billing, and reports
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for error handling, request validation, and rate limiting
- **Database Interaction**: Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, with models defined for each entity

### Database
- **Type**: MongoDB
- **Data Models**: 
  - Reservations
  - Courts
  - Schedules
  - Billing
  - User settings
- **Indexes**: Optimized indexes for efficient querying

### Desktop Application
- **Framework**: Electron
- **Packaging**: Electron Builder for creating an installable .exe file
- **License Management**: Basic license validation system to restrict access to the application

## Deployment and Distribution
- The application is designed to be easily deployable with a straightforward installation process for end-users.
- Documentation will be provided for installation, usage, and packaging to assist users and developers.

## Conclusion
The architecture of SportWare is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring a smooth user experience while providing robust functionality for managing sports facilities. This document serves as a foundational overview for developers and stakeholders involved in the project.
